Thsi is a list of details that have been useful in adding features to rpidatv.

1.   Exit from LCD mode.  If you exit from LCD mode by sending ctrl-C from a terminal, there is no echo at the command prompt.
Re-enable echo by entering "stty echo".

2.  To re-enable the LCD from the command prompt, type

sudo killall fbcp
fbcp &
/home/pi/rpidatv/bin/rpidatvgui 1

Leave out the 1 if not using a waveshare dsiplay.

3.  If you switch the type of LCD display from the console menu more than once, it puts multiple entries in /boot/config.txt.  
This will stop the LCD working.  Edit the file (sudo nano /boot/config.txt) to remove all but the entry for your display and
reboot.  It should then work.
